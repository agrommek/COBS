/**
 * @mainpage Arduino Library for Constistent Overhead Byte Stuffing
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 * This library implements the COBS algorithm. 
 * 
 * Using this algorithm, one can transform a buffer of bytes into 
 * another buffer of bytes which does not contain any zero bytes, for 
 * the cost of (slightly) increased buffer length.
 *  
 * For more information, see here:
 * @li https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing
 * @li http://www.stuartcheshire.org/papers/COBSforToN.pdf
 *
 * Note that there is nothing special about the "zero byte". The algorithm
 * works equally well for any other byte value. However, for reasons of 
 * simplicity the "special byte" is fixed to 0x00 and not a configurable
 * parameter.
